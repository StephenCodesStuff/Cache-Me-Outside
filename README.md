  ## Installation

  Cache Me Outside is fully deployed and can be accessed [here.](https://cache-me-outside-aaacc989ab5f.herokuapp.com/)

  ## Usage

  The website is accessible to anyone without credentials - however, to access the profile pages and the ability to create new caches, the user must create an account. For testing purposes, the following credentials can be used to access the profile pages:

  ```
  username: bootcamp@test.com
  password: bootcamp
  ```

  The homepage opens allowing user to see a brief how to play and an easy to see map of the hidden caches in their area.
