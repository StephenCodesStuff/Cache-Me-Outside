  ## Description

  
 Cache Me Outside - the ultimate scavenger hunt app!

 Our new geocaching website, "Cache Me Outside" is a digital platform that aims to revolutionize the way people engage with outdoor geocaching hunting activities. By combining the thrill of adventure, problem-solving, and technology, “Cache Me Outside” offers an immersive experience for treasure hunters of all ages and abilities. Users can explore real-world locations and unlock hidden treasures, all while fostering a sense of curiosity and discovery.
  
  ## Installation

  Cache Me Outside is fully deployed and can be accessed [here.](https://cache-me-outside-aaacc989ab5f.herokuapp.com/)

  ## Usage

  The website is accessible to anyone without credentials - however, to access the profile pages and the ability to create new caches, the user must create an account. For testing purposes, the following credentials can be used to access the profile pages:

  ```
  username: bootcamp@test.com
  password: bootcamp
  ```

Upon visiting the site, you will find a brief introduction to the application and a synopsis of how to play. When you scroll down, you will see an interactive map of all caches currently stored in the database. Clicking on the body of one of these tiles will zoom the map to the hidden location, and clicking on 'more details' will bring you to a page with an expanded view and more details.

By clicking login, you are prompted to either log in with existing credentials or create a new account. Once logged in, you can access your profile page, which will display all of the caches you have created. You can also create a new cache by clicking the 'create cache' button or delete an existing cache by clicking the 'delete cache' button.
